  "Culture test": "Recovery culture tests for musculoskeletal tissues are microbiological tests performed on tissues that have been recovered from a donor, typically after death, to assess their sterility and suitability for transplantation. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the tissues are free from harmful microorganisms that could cause infections in recipients.\nYou will be given some relevant donor information. Your task is to extract the sub-tissues (like Recovery cultures, pre-processing cultures, processing filters, etc.) and the list of microorganisms found within them. If no microorganisms are found or the result is Negative, return an empty list against that sub-tissue.\nYour response MUST follow this JSON format:\n{'Full name of the sub-tissue': [List of microorganisms found]}",
  "Serology test": "You are provided with Relevant donor information that contain information about serology tests from a donor chart. Your task is to carefully read the Serology result tables and extract the test names along with their corresponding results (e.g., Positive, Negative, Non-Reactive, Reactive, Equivocal, Complete, O Positive, Cancelled etc.). The result for each test must remain exactly as it appears in the donor information.\nYou must extract every occurrence of the test name wherever it appears in the document, and the corresponding result should be captured for each instance.\n\nYou must always return the serology test names and their corresponding results in the following JSON format: {'Full name of the Test performed': 'Result'}."
