  "Culture test": "Recovery culture tests for musculoskeletal tissues are microbiological tests performed on tissues that have been recovered from a donor, typically after death, to assess their sterility and suitability for transplantation. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the tissues are free from harmful microorganisms that could cause infections in recipients.\n\nYou will be given some relevant donor information. Your task is to extract the sub-tissues (like Recovery cultures, pre-processing cultures, post-processing cultures, processing filters, etc.) and the list of microorganisms found within them.\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n1. Extract the FULL, EXACT name of each sub-tissue as it appears in the document (e.g., 'Left Femur Recovery Culture', 'Right Semitendinosus Pre-Processing Culture', 'Cardiac Processing Representative Sample').\n2. For each sub-tissue, extract ALL microorganisms found, including:\n   - Genus and species names (e.g., 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Escherichia coli')\n   - Generic descriptions (e.g., 'Gram positive cocci', 'Yeast', 'Mold')\n   - Any qualifiers (e.g., 'coagulase negative', 'beta-hemolytic')\n3. If no microorganisms are found, the result is Negative, or the culture shows 'No Growth', return an empty list [] for that sub-tissue.\n4. Do NOT extract culture results for blood, sputum, urine, stool, or bronchial samples - only tissue cultures.\n5. Handle variations in tissue naming (e.g., 'tib/fib' vs 'tibia/fibula', 'radius/ulna' vs 'ulna/radius').\n6. If a microorganism is listed with 'species' or 'spp', you may include it but note that post-processing will normalize this.\n\nYour response MUST follow this JSON format:\n{'Full name of the sub-tissue': [List of microorganisms found]}\n\nExample:\n{\"Left Femur Recovery Culture\": [\"Staphylococcus epidermidis\", \"Propionibacterium acnes\"], \"Right Semitendinosus Recovery Culture\": [], \"Cardiac Processing Representative Sample\": [\"Candida albicans\"]}",
  "Serology test": "You are provided with Relevant donor information that contain information about serology tests from a donor chart. Your task is to carefully read the Serology result tables and extract the test names along with their corresponding results.\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n1. Extract test names EXACTLY as they appear in the document, including any abbreviations, manufacturer names, or method designations (e.g., 'HIV-1/HIV-2 Plus O', 'HBsAg (Alinity)', 'CMV IgG (EIA)').\n2. Extract results EXACTLY as they appear, including:\n   - Standard results: Positive, Negative, Non-Reactive, Reactive, Equivocal, Indeterminate, Borderline\n   - Blood type results: O Positive, A Negative, B Positive, AB Negative, etc.\n   - Status indicators: Complete, Cancelled, Pending, Not Tested\n   - Any quantitative values if present (e.g., titers, ratios)\n3. Extract EVERY occurrence of each test name wherever it appears in the document, capturing the corresponding result for each instance.\n4. If a test appears multiple times with different results, include all instances.\n5. Do NOT alter, normalize, or standardize test names or results - maintain them exactly as they appear in the source document.\n6. If a test name appears but no result is visible or the result is unclear, do NOT include that test in your output.\n7. Pay attention to test panels or combined tests (e.g., 'Ultrio Elite HIV/HCV/HBV') and extract them as single test entries.\n8. Handle variations in test naming (e.g., 'anti-HIV' vs 'HIV Antibody', 'HBsAg' vs 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigen') - extract as written.\n\nYou must always return the serology test names and their corresponding results in the following JSON format: {'Full name of the Test performed': 'Result'}.\n\nExample:\n{\"HIV-1/HIV-2 Plus O\": \"Non-Reactive\", \"Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)\": \"Negative\", \"Hepatitis C Antibody (anti-HCV)\": \"Non-Reactive\", \"Syphilis (RPR)\": \"Non-Reactive\", \"ABO-Rh\": \"O Positive\"}"
